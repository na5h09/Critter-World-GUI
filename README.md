# Critters GUI

This is a Critters Game that allows the user to generate various critters into a grid world. The user can allow certain amounts of time to pass in this world or make it
continuously run. During these time intervals, critters will reproduce, fight each other, or just keep moving. This generally a new Critter ecosystem that was created, and can
be reset at any moment.
